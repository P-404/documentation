[CENTER][B]Finally!! The wait is over We present You Project-404

Leonardo Da Vinci, said
"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
And with that Goal in mind we bring you the Rom you don't think you need but the one you deserve,

(Oof sigh enough with quotes you must be getting bored) . So some of you might be like, sigh yet another Rom. Ugh we get it too, but give us a shot.

Our core ideology for this Project is Aesthetic we are more focused on Aesthetic but also considering the usability since Aesthetic is as much as important as Usability and Stability.
